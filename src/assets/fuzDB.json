Deletion of one or more \u00ce\u00b2 spectrin domains also resulted in step-wise reduction of K2 affinity.", "description_structure": "Binding is driven by electrostatic interactions. Docking models show interactions between charged KAHRP residues and complementary charged clusters of spectrin. Interestingly, the MD simulations also evidence the dynamic behavior in the KAHRP\u00e2\u20ac\u201cspectrin complex as demonstrated by small changes in the binding conformation. Owing to non-specific electrostatic contacts, binding between \u00ce\u00b210\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14 and the KAHRP 5 \u00cc\u0081 repeat enhanced only by 2- to 5-fold by sequence specific interactions. This is comparable to the overall margin of specificity observed for KAHRP binding to spectrin fragments.", "description_mechanism": "tethering", "description_postt": "", "description_isoforms": "", "description_significance": "Fuzziness of the complex weakens sequence requirements for binding and enable gradual changes in affinity.", "description_medical": "", "description_further": "", "sequence": "", "picture": "", "picture_h": "", "delete_flag": "", "username": "fuxreiter", "contact_mail": "ioannis.vakonakis@bioch.ox.ac.uk", "contact_name": "Ioannis Vakonakis", "created_date": "2018.
